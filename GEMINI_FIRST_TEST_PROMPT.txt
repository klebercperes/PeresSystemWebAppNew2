I'm working on the Peres Systems frontend codebase and need your help. This is my first time using you with this project, so please follow these instructions carefully.

## Step 1: Read the Documentation

Please read and understand these documentation files from the repository:

1. **docs/AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md** - This is the MAIN guide. It explains:
   - The architecture and code structure
   - Critical rules (especially about the API layer)
   - How to make changes without breaking things
   - Best practices and patterns

2. **docs/API_REFERENCE.md** - Complete reference for:
   - All available API methods
   - TypeScript type definitions
   - Error handling examples
   - How to use each method

3. **docs/README.md** - Documentation index and quick start

4. **GEMINI_SETUP.md** - Setup instructions and example prompts

5. **GEMINI_TEST_PROMPT.md** - Testing instructions

## Step 2: Understand the Architecture

Key points you MUST understand:

1. **API Layer Abstraction**: 
   - ALL backend communication goes through `services/api.ts`
   - Components MUST NEVER make direct `fetch()` calls
   - This is critical to prevent breaking changes

2. **File Structure**:
   - `services/api.ts` - ALL API calls (the only file that talks to backend)
   - `services/auth.ts` - Authentication only
   - `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
   - `components/` - UI components (use api object, no direct fetch)
   - `pages/` - Page components (use api object, no direct fetch)

3. **Pattern to Follow**:
   ```
   Component → services/api.ts → Backend API → Database
   ```

## Step 3: Test Task

After reading the documentation, please help me with this simple test:

**Task**: Review the `components/ClientManager.tsx` file and verify it follows the architecture rules:
1. Does it use the `api` object from `services/api.ts`?
2. Does it avoid direct `fetch()` calls?
3. Does it use TypeScript types from `types.ts`?
4. Does it handle errors properly?

Please provide:
- A brief analysis of the file
- Confirmation that it follows the rules
- Any suggestions for improvement (if needed)

## Step 4: Confirm Understanding

Before proceeding, please confirm you understand:
- ✅ The API layer must never be bypassed
- ✅ All components use `api` object from `services/api.ts`
- ✅ TypeScript types are in `types.ts`
- ✅ Error handling is important
- ✅ You'll follow existing patterns when making changes

## Important Notes

- The repository is at: `https://github.com/klebercperes/PeresSystemWebAppNew2`
- All documentation is in the `docs/` folder
- The main API service is in `services/api.ts`
- Never suggest or create code that bypasses the API layer

Please start by reading the documentation files listed above, then complete the test task.
